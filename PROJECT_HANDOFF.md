# TheGameOf2D Project Handoff

## Project Basics

- Project path: `D:\UE_project\TheGameOf2D`
- Unreal project file: `D:\UE_project\TheGameOf2D\TheGameOf2D.uproject`
- Engine: Unreal Engine 5.7
- GitHub repo: `https://github.com/xzh16689592007/TheGameOf2D`
- Branch: `main`
- Game concept: `墨灯守巷`, a 2.5D side-view lantern-defense action prototype.
- Training requirement: gameplay logic should use C++; Blueprint can be used for assets, tuning, UI, materials, VFX, animation, etc.

## Current Design Direction

- Use 3D assets and 3D scene, but lock gameplay into a 2.5D side-scrolling style.
- Player movement is constrained to a side-scrolling plane.
- No Paper2D/PaperZD currently.
- Main gameplay loop:
  - Lanterns have durability.
  - Enemies move toward the nearest lit lantern.
  - Enemies attack lanterns and reduce durability.
  - Player repairs lanterns with `E` or `F`.
  - Player attacks enemies with left mouse button or `J`.
  - Killing enemies gives ink.
  - Ink upgrades weapon level automatically.
  - Spawner controls waves.
  - All lanterns extinguished means defeat.
  - Clearing all waves means victory.

## Important C++ Classes

- `AModengLantern`
  - Files:
    - `Source/TheGameOf2D/ModengLantern.h`
    - `Source/TheGameOf2D/ModengLantern.cpp`
  - Has durability, repair, damage, light intensity/color update.
  - Implements `ISideScrollingInteractable`.

- `AModengEnemy`
  - Files:
    - `Source/TheGameOf2D/ModengEnemy.h`
    - `Source/TheGameOf2D/ModengEnemy.cpp`
  - Base enemy class.
  - Finds nearest non-extinguished lantern.
  - Moves along X axis toward the target lantern.
  - Attacks lantern when in range.
  - Has health and ink reward.
  - Enemy collision is query/overlap only, so enemies do not physically block player or each other.
  - Has `EnemyBody` as a `UStaticMeshComponent` for current visuals.
  - Uses inherited `ACharacter::Mesh` for animated skeletal visuals when available.
  - C++ default skeletal visuals load `SK_Stickman` and `ABP_Stickman`.
  - C++ default animation hooks load Stickman idle, walk, attack, hit, and death animation sequences.
  - C++ can directly drive idle/walk looping animations with `bUseDirectLocomotionAnimations`, which avoids relying on the animation blueprint receiving movement speed from manual `SetActorLocation` movement.
  - Attacking a lantern temporarily plays the attack animation sequence, then restores the animation blueprint.
  - Taking non-lethal damage plays a hit animation and still updates the health bar.
  - Dying plays the death animation sequence, disables collision immediately, then destroys after the animation/delay.
  - `EnemyBody` remains as a static mesh fallback and is hidden when skeletal visuals are enabled.
  - `BP_ModengEnemy` previously used `SM_Stickman` on `EnemyBody`; C++ now prefers the skeletal Stickman setup at runtime.
  - C++ supports optional material color override and hit flash for placeholder visuals. For imported art, keep `bOverrideBodyMaterialColor` false so the model keeps its own material.

- `AModengFastEnemy`
  - Files:
    - `Source/TheGameOf2D/ModengFastEnemy.h`
    - `Source/TheGameOf2D/ModengFastEnemy.cpp`
  - Inherits `AModengEnemy`.
  - Faster, lower health, faster attack interval.
  - Currently keeps placeholder/static visual defaults; `bUseSkeletalMeshVisuals` is disabled in C++ until it gets a distinct animated setup.

- `AModengExploderEnemy`
  - Files:
    - `Source/TheGameOf2D/ModengExploderEnemy.h`
    - `Source/TheGameOf2D/ModengExploderEnemy.cpp`
  - Inherits `AModengEnemy`.
  - Overrides attack behavior.
  - Bursts near lantern, deals larger damage, then dies.
  - Currently keeps placeholder/static visual defaults; `bUseSkeletalMeshVisuals` is disabled in C++ until it gets a distinct animated setup.

- `AModengEnemySpawner`
  - Files:
    - `Source/TheGameOf2D/ModengEnemySpawner.h`
    - `Source/TheGameOf2D/ModengEnemySpawner.cpp`
  - Wave-based spawner.
  - Exposes `EnemyTypes`, `TotalWaves`, `BaseEnemiesPerWave`, `ExtraEnemiesPerWave`, `SpawnInterval`, `MaxAliveEnemies`, `DelayBetweenWaves`.
  - Checks victory/defeat.
  - Shows C++ result UI on victory/defeat.
  - Exposes `OnGameEnded`, `OnVictory`, and `OnDefeat` delegates for Blueprint/UI/VFX hooks.
  - Restores gameplay input on BeginPlay as a safety net after restarting from the result screen.

- `UModengResultWidget`
  - Files:
    - `Source/TheGameOf2D/ModengResultWidget.h`
    - `Source/TheGameOf2D/ModengResultWidget.cpp`
  - Native C++ UMG result widget.
  - Shows Victory/Defeat text.
  - Provides Restart and Quit buttons.
  - Restart restores `GameOnly` input mode, hides mouse cursor, unpauses, removes the widget, then reloads the current level.

- `AModengHUD`
  - Files:
    - `Source/TheGameOf2D/ModengHUD.h`
    - `Source/TheGameOf2D/ModengHUD.cpp`
  - C++ HUD drawn with `AHUD::DrawHUD`.
  - Displays wave status, enemies alive, lantern status, weapon level, ink, damage, range.
  - It is assigned in `ASideScrollingGameMode` constructor.

- `ASideScrollingCharacter`
  - Files:
    - `Source/TheGameOf2D/Variant_SideScrolling/SideScrollingCharacter.h`
    - `Source/TheGameOf2D/Variant_SideScrolling/SideScrollingCharacter.cpp`
  - Modified from UE side-scrolling template.
  - Interaction:
    - `E` and `F` call `DoInteract()`.
    - Uses overlap query to find actors implementing `ISideScrollingInteractable`.
  - Attack:
    - `J` and left mouse button call `DoAttack()`.
    - Uses a box overlap from the player forward, not a single sphere.
    - Has a short cylinder-based slash/range visual instead of the old debug cube.
    - Applies light knockback to enemies that survive the hit.
  - Progression:
    - `AddInk()`
    - weapon level
    - damage/range/radius scaling.

## Current Controls

- Move: side-scrolling template movement input.
- Jump: template jump input.
- Repair/interact: `E` or `F`.
- Attack: left mouse button or `J`.

## Current Visual Asset State

- `BP_ModengEnemy` has been updated manually in UE:
  - `EnemyBody.StaticMesh = SM_Stickman`.
  - `EnemyBody` transform was adjusted so the Stickman stands on the ground.
  - `EnemyBody` material was changed to a Stickman material instance, so it no longer appears white.
- Basic enemy skeletal animation upgrade has started in C++:
  - `AModengEnemy` uses the inherited `ACharacter::Mesh` component.
  - Default skeletal mesh is `SK_Stickman`.
  - Default animation blueprint is `ABP_Stickman`.
  - Default idle animation is `A_Stickman_Idle`.
  - Default walk animation is `A_Stickman_Walk`.
  - Default attack animation is `A_Stickman_Attack_01`.
  - Default hit/knockback animation is `A_Stickman_hit_back`.
  - Default death animation is `A_Stickman_Death`.
  - Collision remains on the capsule, not the mesh.
  - Static `EnemyBody` is retained as a fallback and hidden when skeletal visuals are active.
- Fast and exploder enemies still need distinct model/animation setup.

## Build Commands

Use this full build command when UE is closed:

```powershell
& "D:\UE_5.7\Engine\Build\BatchFiles\Build.bat" TheGameOf2DEditor Win64 Development -Project="D:\UE_project\TheGameOf2D\TheGameOf2D.uproject" -WaitMutex
```

If UE is open and Live Coding is active, full build will fail with:

```text
Unable to build while Live Coding is active
```

In that case either:

- Press `Ctrl + Alt + F11` inside UE for Live Coding, or
- Close UE and run full build.

Important: after adding new C++ classes, prefer closing UE and running a full build before reopening. Otherwise Blueprints can temporarily show parent class missing.

## Toolchain

- Visual Studio 2026 is installed.
- MSVC 14.44 is used and works.
- Full compile has succeeded multiple times with:

```text
Using Visual Studio 2026 14.44.35227 toolchain
Result: Succeeded
```

The UnrealBuildTool config forcing 14.44 exists at:

```text
C:\Users\Lenovo\AppData\Roaming\Unreal Engine\UnrealBuildTool\BuildConfiguration.xml
```

Expected content:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

## Git Setup And Notes

- `.gitignore` exists and ignores:
  - `Binaries/`
  - `Intermediate/`
  - `Saved/`
  - `DerivedDataCache/`
  - `.vs/`
- `.gitattributes` exists and tracks `.uasset`, `.umap`, images, audio, video, etc. through Git LFS.
- Git LFS is installed and initialized.
- The Fab asset import under `Content/ROG_Creatures` should be committed through Git LFS.
- `Config/DefaultEditor.ini` may get noisy editor preview-profile changes from opening imported assets. Do not commit those preview-profile changes unless the team explicitly wants editor profile settings in source control.

Team clone instructions:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xzh16689592007/TheGameOf2D.git
cd TheGameOf2D
git lfs pull
```

## Known Issues / Rough Edges

- Basic enemy now has C++ skeletal Stickman defaults and direct idle/walk/attack/hit/death animation sequence hooks. User tested it in UE and reported no issues.
- Fast and exploder enemies still need their own distinct model/animation setup.
- HUD is C++ Canvas HUD, not polished UMG.
- Player still uses the default template character appearance.
- Player attack has gameplay logic and range feedback, but no polished character attack animation yet.
- Enemy movement currently follows X axis only. This is fine for ground-level lanterns, but platform lanterns need route points, flying enemies, ranged enemies, or a 2.5D path system later.
- Most debug messages now have exposed `bShowGameplayDebugMessages` toggles and are off by default.
- If all lanterns are on platforms or unreachable by X-only enemies, enemies may not behave as intended.
- Current game lacks polished player art, sound, particles, and UI art.

## Suggested Next Steps

1. Find and import a better player character model:
   - Prefer UE5 Manny/Quinn-compatible humanoid assets.
   - Good search keywords: `UE5`, `Manny`, `Quinn`, `Humanoid`, `Rigged`, `Retarget`, `Animation Blueprint`.
   - Prefer assets with idle, walk/run, jump, and attack animations.

2. Replace player visual appearance:
   - Keep existing player movement, jump, repair, and attack gameplay logic.
   - Start by swapping only the visible skeletal mesh/animation setup.
   - Avoid large gameplay rewrites while testing the new character art.

3. Add player attack animation:
   - Play an attack animation on left mouse / `J`.
   - Keep the existing attack overlap and slash visual until animation timing is tuned.

4. Later: give fast and exploder enemies distinct polished visuals:
   - Fast enemy can be smaller/lighter/faster-looking.
   - Exploder enemy can be larger/redder/more volatile-looking.
   - They currently remain acceptable placeholders because their shapes distinguish enemy types.

5. Later: upgrade enemy movement beyond X-axis:
   - Route point system for platform levels.
   - Flying enemy.
   - Ranged enemy.
   - Climber enemy.
